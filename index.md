## Welcome to the workshop on Parallel and Distributed Automated Reasoning 2022

In 2022, the workshop will be affiliated with [FLOC-22](https://www.floc2022.org/)

** Early bird registration deadline is 20th of June **

** Online registration deadline is 20th of July **

### Goals and Scope of Workshop

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers working on
the theory, practice, and application of parallel and distributed
automated reasoning. Whilst parallel and distributed computational
resources have become more widely abundant, and utilised in many areas
of computer science, the area of automated reasoning has not embraced
this as fully. Through this workshop we aim to provide a platform for
researchers to present and discuss solutions and challenges when
considering the parallel or distributed execution of automated
reasoners, including those from the fields of CP, SAT, SMT, ASP,
(first-order and higher-order) ATP, and CHC, including the full range of
algorithmic approaches. The aim is to create a broad forum that allows
the cross-fertilisation of ideas e.g. allowing ideas from parallel SAT
solving to inspire ATP techniques, or vice-versa.

The workshop is interested in theoretical frameworks, practical
implementations, experimental studies, and applications of parallel or
distributed reasoning. Relevant parallel or distributed approaches may
include (but are not limited to):

 - Data-parallelism supported by GPU acceleration
 - Vertical scaling on shared-memory multicore machines
 - Horizontal scaling on distributed cluster or cloud resources
